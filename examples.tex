\begin{question}[Adwait]
Given a PA formula $\phi(i, j, \dots)$ such that for all $i$, there exists a unique $j$ such that $\phi$ holds. Can we explicitly express $j$ in terms of $i$, given a proof of this dependence?
\end{question}

\begin{example}
Consider $$\phi \equiv (0 < i) \land (0 < j) \land (i < 9) \land (j < 9) \land (\exists q. i - 2j -9q = 0)$$
\end{example}
This is a \emph{permutation} over $\{1, \dots, 8\}$: we have that whenever $\phi(i, j)$ holds, $i \equiv 2j \mod 9$, $j \equiv 5i \mod 9$

A proof of uniqueness of $j$ for a given $i$ would proceed by contradiction, eliminating $i$ and then using the fact $9$ divides $2(j' - j)$ and that $2$ and $9$ are coprime, and that $-9 <  j - j' < 9$ 

To capture this example, our calculus somehow would need to support division with remainder, and even then, getting the explicit expression from a proof of uniqueness might be tricky...
